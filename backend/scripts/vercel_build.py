"""Build step for the API project on Vercel.

Vercel runs this after installing dependencies and before the new version
starts serving traffic (see [tool.vercel.scripts] in pyproject.toml), which
makes it the right moment to apply database migrations.

By default migrations only run for production deployments. Otherwise every
preview deployment of an unmerged branch would change the production
database. If you've turned on Neon's preview branching (each preview gets
its own copy of the database), set MIGRATE_PREVIEWS=1 to migrate those too.
